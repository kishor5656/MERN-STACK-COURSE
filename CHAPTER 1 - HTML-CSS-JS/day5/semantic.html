            In the 1960s, Ford and Ferrari were engaged in a legendary rivalry that played out on the racetrack. It began when Henry Ford II attempted to acquire Ferrari, but Enzo Ferrari refused. In response, Ford developed the GT40, a race car designed specifically to beat Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. The rivalry intensified over the next few years, with Ferrari dominating the race until 1966, when the Ford GT40 finally emerged victorious. Ford went on to win the next three Le Mans races, solidifying its place in racing history. The rivalry between Ford and Ferrari has become a symbol of American ingenuity and determination against Italian passion and design. The story was immortalized in the 2019 film "Ford v Ferrari," which tells the story of the epic battle between these two automotive giants.
