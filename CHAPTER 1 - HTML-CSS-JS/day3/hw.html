    <p title="this is a paragraph">
        The wisdom of the crowd refers to the idea that a large group of diverse and independent thinkers can
        collectively come up with a better answer than any single expert. Imagine a jar filled with colored marbles.
        Each person in the crowd guesses the number of marbles, and even though individual guesses might be off,
        averaging them all together often lands remarkably close to the actual number. This is because the random errors
        of individuals tend to cancel each other out, revealing the underlying truth. The power of the crowd thrives on
        diversity, the more varied the knowledge and perspectives, the better the collective wisdom.
